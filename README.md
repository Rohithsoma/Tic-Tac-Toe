# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple yet engaging Java-based project where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

This project is designed to enhance logical thinking and Java programming skills, particularly in working with arrays, loops, conditions, and user input handling.
